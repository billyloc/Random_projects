What would you do different to have had a better presentation? I would prepare more. do dry runs of my material, 
and make sure that i know the material clearly. also get feedback from others watching

What area do you feel you are strong? I am not nervous about getting in front of people
which I think is a strong attribute for public speaking. my voice is not low and can project loudly

What area do you feel you are weak? I tend to use a lot of filler words, and... um... so... uh... if im not prepared
i fill dead air with filler words
What information was most interesting? the most interesting part for me, was how bad something
can be even when given ample amount of time to complete the task at hand.
