So I did my first attempt at creating a website today. I started earlier in the day
and just didnt know what I wanted at all in regards to my site. I ended up copying
some tmeplates for previous projects that were made in class, but just didnt feel
like my own website. It wasnt until I got home that I told my wife I was playing
around and making my own site that she suggessted I just make it for myself and
put what I like. This helped becuase it gave me direction on what I wanted my 
site to be. I ended up creating a few pages, finsihing the HTML and CSS for the 
first page and a few others. I am not done at all whatsoever with the page, but its
fun and exciting to me. I cant wait to build off of what I have, and think of ways and 
content to add later on. Time for bed, another day of coding awaits tomorrow....
